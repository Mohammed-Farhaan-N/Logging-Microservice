# Logging Microservice

## Overview

The **Logging Microservice** is a lightweight service designed to handle logging for distributed applications. It captures, processes, and stores logs from different microservices, providing centralized logging for better observability and debugging.

## Features

- Centralized logging for microservices
- Support for structured and unstructured logs
- Integration with cloud storage and monitoring tools
- REST API for log ingestion and retrieval
- Configurable log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, etc.)
- Secure storage of logs

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL (Configurable)
- **Messaging:** Kafka (Optional, for asynchronous logging)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint   | Description                 |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| POST   | /logs      | Ingest a new log entry      |
| GET    | /logs      | Fetch all logs              |
| GET    | /logs/{id} | Fetch log by ID             |
| DELETE | /logs/{id} | Delete a specific log entry |

## Configuration

The service requires the following environment variables:

```properties
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
```

Or, you can set them in the `application.yml` file (avoid committing sensitive data):

```yaml
aws:
  access-key: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY}
  secret-key: ${AWS_SECRET_KEY}

spring:
  datasource:
    url: ${DATABASE_URL}
```

  docker run -p 8080:8080 -e DATABASE_URL=your-db-url logging-microservice
  ```
- **Kubernetes**: Deploy using a Helm chart or Kubernetes YAML configuration.

## Logging & Monitoring

- **Log Storage**: Logs are stored in the configured database.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with Prometheus and Grafana for visualization.
- **Tracing**: Supports OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.
